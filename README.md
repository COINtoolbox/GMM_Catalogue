# GMM_Catalogue
Catalogue with probabilistic classification of galaxies based on their ionization source using Gaussian Mixture Models <img  align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COINtoolbox/photoz_catalogues/master/images/coin.png" width="200">

This is one of the products of the third edition of the [COIN Residence Program](http://iaacoin.wix.com/crp2016), which took place in August/2016 in Budapest (Hungary). 

Any questions/suggestions should be sent to iaa.coin@gmail.com .

The catalogue  is given bellow. Check the individual folders for detailed information on the files presented here. 

## *Galaxy Classification via Gaussian Mixture Models* 


This catalogue was designed to provide soft/probabilistic classifications for galaxies based on their ionization source. The data consists of a combination of the BPT and WHAN diagrams. 

It is constructed from the [SDSS DR12](http://www.sdss.org/dr12/) and the and is available in the following at  [Catalogue](http://linc.tw/).
