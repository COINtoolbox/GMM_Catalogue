This is one of the products of the third edition of the [COIN Residence Program](http://iaacoin.wix.com/crp2016), which took place in August/2016 in Budapest (Hungary). 


The catalogue  is given bellow. Check the individual folders for detailed information on the files presented here. 

## *GMM Catalogue* 

Catalogue with probabilistic classification of galaxies based on their ionization source using Gaussian Mixture Models 

This catalogue was designed to provide soft/probabilistic classifications for galaxies based on their ionization source. The data consists of a combination of the BPT and WHAN diagrams. 

The probabilistic classification of galaxies via GMM  is constructed using data from the [SDSS DR7](http://www.sdss.org/dr7/) and the [SEAGal/STARLIGHT](http://casjobs.starlight.ufsc.br/casjobs/) catalogues and is available at  [Catalogue](https://github.com/COINtoolbox/GMM_Catalogue/blob/master/Catalogue/GMM_catalogue.csv). 

## *Short tutorial for the use of GMM in Python*

Created by [Pierre-Yves Lablanche](https://github.com/pylablanche) and [Madura Killedar](https://github.com/DrMud) and available at [GMM Python tutorial](https://github.com/COINtoolbox/GMM_Catalogue/blob/master/Tutorial/GMM_Python.ipynb)
