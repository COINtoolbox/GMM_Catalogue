# Galaxy Classification via Gaussian Mixture Models
Catalogue with probabilistic classification of galaxies based on their ionization source using Gaussian Mixture Models <img  align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COINtoolbox/photoz_catalogues/master/images/coin.png" width="200">

This is one of the products of the third edition of the [COIN Residence Program](http://iaacoin.wix.com/crp2016), which took place in August/2016 in Budapest (Hungary). 


The catalogue  is given bellow. Check the individual folders for detailed information on the files presented here. 

## *GMM Catalogue* 


This catalogue was designed to provide soft/probabilistic classifications for galaxies based on their ionization source. The data consists of a combination of the BPT and WHAN diagrams. 

The probabilistic classification of galaxies via GMM  is constructed using data from the [SDSS DR7](http://www.sdss.org/dr7/) and the [SEAGal/STARLIGHT](http://casjobs.starlight.ufsc.br/casjobs/) catalogues and is available at  [Catalogue](https://github.com/COINtoolbox/GMM_Catalogue/blob/master/Catalogue/GMM_catalogue.csv).
